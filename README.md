# 100 day's of Rust
This repository is a record of my 100-day journey learning Rust programming language. 

**iNTRO:** Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without needing a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages aren't good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems.

**Goal:** Gain a strong foundation in Rust and low level concepts and develop practical skills through daily coding exercises and projects.

**commit:** 
* `git commit -m "Day 3: Data Types: boolean, sigend and unsigend integers, floating point, platform specific integers, characters, &str, and String, Arrays, tuples and Type aliasing"`

**Tips:**
* Be consistent with your daily practice.
